# BASTA strawberry trial 2022
The biostatistics course project is based on the BASTA research (Biochar’s Added value) organised by ILVO, UHasselt and pcfruit.

Biochar is the residual product formed after pyrolysis of biomass and has currently no economic value. In this project researchers are interested to see if (1) Biochar can partly replace peat and (2) Biochar can be used to promote plant development and/or plant disease resistance of strawberry.

---

**Variables:**

- the type of growing medium (peat, peat_biochar, peatfree, peatfree_biochar)
- the addition of biochar as a vaccine (vaccine 1-3)
- the addition of *Trichoderma* (*Trichoderma* 1-3)

There were a total of 28 growing blends (4 x 3 x 3 + 4 controls). For each blend three plant trays were filled, each containing five strawberry plants, and replicated four times. The trays were divided over two greenhouses (greenhouse 1-2).

**Measurements:**

- root rot score (30, 50, and 80 days after infection)
- total number of fruits over 15 plants
- number of fruits infected with *Botrytis* (after harvest, one week storage at 6°C, and three days storage at 20°C)
- weight of strawberries per plant in kg (class 1, class 2, curved, and total strawberries)
- fresh biomass per plant
- dry biomass per plant

**Research question:**  
On average, is there an effect of growing medium and/or the addition of Trichoderma on the weight of the curved strawberries. (data set 2)

Ha3: The effect of *Trichoderma* addition on the weight of the curved strawberries differs for the different growth media.  

# Data Exploration
First we filter the data, generate an appropriate format, and provide some basic statistics.

```{r}
df <- data.frame(data[,c(1, 4:5, 9, 19)])
df$Greenhouse <- factor(df$Greenhouse)
df$Trichoderma <- factor(df$Trichoderma)
df$Substrate <- factor(df$Substrate)

head(df)
summary(df)
```

Next, some basic plots are generated to provide an initial intuitive view on the effects of the explanatory variables.

```{r}
# plots effect of substrate choice
df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=Substrate, y=Curved_strawberries, fill=Substrate)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(
    title = "Effect of substrate choice on the weight of curved strawberries", 
    y = "Curved strawberry weight per plant (kg)") + 
  geom_jitter(width=0.2, alpha=0.3) +
  theme_bw()

# plots effect of Trichoderma addition
df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=Trichoderma, y=Curved_strawberries, fill=Trichoderma)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(
    title = "Effect of Trichoderma addition on the weight of curved strawberries", 
    y = "Curved strawberry weight per plant (kg)") + 
  geom_jitter(width=0.2, alpha=0.3) +
  theme_bw()

# plots effect of greenhouse choice
df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=Greenhouse, y=Curved_strawberries, fill=Greenhouse)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(
    title = "Effect of greenhouse choice on the weight of curved strawberries", 
    y = "Curved strawberry weight per plant (kg)") + 
  geom_jitter(width=0.2, alpha=0.3) +
  theme_bw()

# barchart to check the equality of variances
df %>%
  filter(Trichoderma %in% c("None","Trich1","Trich2","Trich3")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Substrate, y=Curved_strawberries, fill=Trichoderma)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") + 
       labs(
         title="Interactive effect of the substrate and trichoderma addition\non the weight of curved strawberries",
         x = "Type of substrate",
         y = "Weight of curved strawberries") +
  theme_bw()
```

We can see that substrate choice (and to a lesser extent *Trichoderma* addition) seems to have an effect on the weight of curved strawberries. The choice of greenhouse, however, does not seem to have an effect but does show difference in variance.

To investigate further, a plot was generated that distinguishes between the substrate choice & *Trichoderma* addition effects. This leads to believe that the effects of both explanatory variables are linked.

```{r}
# plots effect of substrate choice & Trichoderma addition
df %>% 
  filter(Trichoderma %in% c("None","Trich1","Trich2","Trich3")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Substrate, y=Curved_strawberries, fill=Trichoderma)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
    labs(
    title = "Effect of substrate choice & Trichoderma addition\non the weight of curved strawberries", 
    y = "Curved strawberry weight per plant (kg)") + 
  geom_jitter(width=0.2, alpha=0.3) +
  theme_bw()
```

Due to the limited number of observations and the large number of variables, trends in these plots should not be taken for granted and further statistical investigation will be performed.

# Model Selection & Statisticial Inference

## Assumption checking
To check normality, histograms & QQ-plots are generated.

```{r}
df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Curved_strawberries)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "#D95C68", binwidth = 0.001) +
      labs(
    title = "Normality confirmation of curved strawberry weight measures: Histogram", 
    x = "Curved strawberry weight per plant (kg)") + 
  theme_bw()

df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(sample = Curved_strawberries)) +
  stat_qq() +
  stat_qq_line(col = "#D95C68") +
  labs(
    title = "Normality confirmation of curved strawberry weight measures: QQ-plot", 
    x = "Theoretical Quantiles",
    y = "Sample Quantities") + 
  theme_bw()
```

The data are not normally distributed with a tail to the right. A square root-transformation might help to make the data more normally distributed. The assumptions are re-evaluated.

```{r warning=FALSE}
df_t <- df
df_t$Curved_strawberries <- ((df_t$Curved_strawberries)^0.5)

df_t %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Curved_strawberries)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "#D95C68") +
      labs(
    title = "Normality confirmation of curved strawberry weight measures\nafter square root-transormation: Histogram", 
    x = "Curved strawberry weight per plant (kg)") + 
  theme_bw()

df_t %>% 
  ggplot(aes(sample = Curved_strawberries)) +
  stat_qq() +
  stat_qq_line(col = "#D95C68") +
  labs(
    title = "Normality confirmation of curved strawberry weight measures\nafter square root-transformation: QQ-plot", 
    x = "Theoretical Quantiles",
    y = "Sample Quantities") + 
  theme_bw()
```

A square root transformation had a beneficial effect on the normality of the data. Backtranstransformation will have to be performed during model interpretation. *It was noticed however, that there is an observation where the weight of curved strawberries is zero. ...*

Although homoscedasticity seems to be met (based on the previous boxplots), an additional sanity check is performed with Levene’s test (robust against normality violations). If the resulting p-value is greater than 0.05, the null-hypothesis cannot be rejected - meaning that sample variance is likely to have occurred based on random sampling from a population with equal variances.

```{r warning=FALSE}
library(car)
leveneTest(Curved_strawberries ~ Substrate*Trichoderma, data = df_t)
```

## Model fitting

A model is generated with substrate-choice, *Trichoderma*-addition, and an interaction variable between both as explanatory variables.

```{r}
# set peatfree as intercept (peatfree is control soil)
df_t <- within(df_t, Substrate <- relevel(Substrate, ref = "Peatfree"))

fit = lm(Curved_strawberries ~ Substrate + Trichoderma + Substrate:Trichoderma, data = df_t)
summary(fit)
plot(fit)

CIfit = confint(fit)
CIfit
```

There is not enough data to assess homoscedasticity for every variable combination. The QQ-plot of the residuals suggests that they are normally distributed, however, there are only a limited number of observations to assess normality. This should be kept in mind for further analysis.

```{r}
anova(fit)
```
When performing anova, only a significant result can be seen with substrate as a explanatory variable.


Linear model fit with only substrate as a explanatory variable:

```{r}
fit2 <- lm(Curved_strawberries ~ Substrate, data = df_t) 
summary(fit2)
```

### Blocking

There could be an effect of the greenhouse on the data. As the greenhouses can have slightly different temperatures, humidity, soils, ... 

Therefore we should incorporate the greenhouse variable in the moddel. (blocking)

```{r}
fit3 = lm(Curved_strawberries ~ Substrate + Trichoderma + Substrate:Trichoderma + Greenhouse, 
          data = df_t)
anova(fit3)
summary(fit3)
```
## Contrast matrix

```{r}
#Design
X <- model.matrix(~Substrate*Trichoderma,data = df_t)
```
